The solution involves using conditional rendering and checking for window availability before accessing window-related methods or properties within the library's code.  If the library's source code is accessible, modify the problematic parts to include a check for the `window` object's existence:

```javascript
// bugSolution.js
import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
import ThirdPartyLibrary from 'third-party-library'; // Replace with your library

function MyComponent() {
  const [isWindowAvailable, setIsWindowAvailable] = useState(typeof window !== 'undefined');

  useEffect(() => {
    if (typeof window !== 'undefined') {
      // Perform any window-dependent setup here
      setIsWindowAvailable(true);
    }
  }, []);

  return (
    <div>
      {isWindowAvailable && <ThirdPartyLibrary />}
      {!isWindowAvailable && <p>Library unavailable in this environment.</p>}
    </div>
  );
}

export default MyComponent;
```

Alternatively, if modifying the third-party library is not feasible, you can wrap the library's usage within a conditional check in your main application code, similar to the solution above. This approach ensures that the library's code is only executed when the `window` object is accessible.
