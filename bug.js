While building an Expo project, I encountered an unusual error related to the interaction between Expo's `react-native-web` and a third-party library that utilizes `window` objects. The error manifested as an unexpected behavior or crash during runtime in the web browser, specifically when the library attempted to access methods or properties associated with the `window` object within a context where it was not readily available. This issue was particularly perplexing because the library functioned correctly in native mobile environments and didn't trigger any errors during the development phase on a device simulator. The error logs provided limited insight beyond a general reference to undefined `window` object causing a runtime error.
